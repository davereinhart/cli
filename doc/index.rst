Nextstrain CLI
==============

.. warning::
   This is the Nextstrain CLI's reference documentation. For the general Nextstrain docs, go here: :doc:`docs:index`

This is the documentation for the `Nextstrain <https://nextstrain.org>`__
command-line interface (CLI)---a program called ``nextstrain``---which aims to
provide a consistent way to run and visualize pathogen builds and access
Nextstrain components like :doc:`Augur <augur:index>` and :doc:`Auspice
<auspice:index>` across computing environments such
as `Docker <https://docker.com>`__, `Conda
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__, and `AWS Batch
<https://aws.amazon.com/batch/>`__.

.. note::
    If you're unfamiliar with Nextstrain builds, you may want to follow our
    :doc:`docs:tutorials/running-a-workflow` tutorial first and then come back
    here.

Big Picture

overview of the `big picture <_static/big-picture.svg>`__:

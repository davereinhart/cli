Delete datasets and narratives on a remote source.

dataset in the Nextstrain Group "blab"::

    nextstrain remote delete nextstrain.org/groups/blab/beta-cov

The :option:`--recursively` option allows for deleting multiple datasets or narratives
at once, e.g. to delete all the "ncov/wa/â€¦" datasets in the "blab" group::

    nextstrain remote delete --recursively nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/wa

See :command-reference:`nextstrain remote` for more information on remote sources.

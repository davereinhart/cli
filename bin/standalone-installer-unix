To make the "nextstrain" command available in your default shell ($shell)
without using the full path, please run these two commands now:

    echo 'source <("$DESTINATION/nextstrain" init-shell $shell)' >> $rc
    source <("$DESTINATION/nextstrain" init-shell $shell)

The first adds a line to your shell initialization file ($rc) for future
sessions.  The second sets up your current shell session.  You only need to run
these once.
